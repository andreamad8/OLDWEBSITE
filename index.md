I am a PhD candidate in Electronic & Computer Engineering at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](www.ust.hk) and part of the [Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research](https://caire.ust.hk/) (CAiRE).

<br/>
I was born in [Perugia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia), where I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Perugia](https://www.unipg.it/en/). After that, I moved to [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong), to study for my first Master Degree. Afterwards, I moved back to Italy  where I obtained my second Master Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pisa). Currenly, I am back to Hong Kong for my PhD studies at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

<br/>
My research interests are: [Learning to Learn](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearner.html) (a.k.a. meta-learning), End-to-End dialogue systems using [Memory Augmented Neural Networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101), and [Multi-Task learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-task_learning) for word and sentence level embeddings.

<br/>
I am a reviewer for NAACL, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, Journal of Natural Language Engineering and Computer Speech and Languages.
