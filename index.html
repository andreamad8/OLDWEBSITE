                                        I was born in Perugia, where I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Perugia. After that, I moved to Hong Kong, where I obtained my first Master Degree in Advanced Information Systems with honours at Hong Kong Baptist
                            University. There, I also worked as a Research Assistant at the Center of Health Informatics in the Computer Science Department. Afterwards, I obtained my second Master Degree in Computer Science at the University of Pisa. Currently. I am currently a Research Assistant at the Human Language Technology Center of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I love Algorithms,
                            Artificial Intelligence, and playing the Ukulele.

                                This is a TensorFlow implementation of the Question Dependent Recurrent Entity Network (QDREN),
                                which is a customization of the original Recurrent Entity Network (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03969">Henaff, 2017</a>).
                                In QDREN we basically modified the infrastructure of the original gating function,
                                by taking in consideration the question in input. A description paper is available arXiv preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07922">arXiv:1707.07922</a>.

                            The proposed model exploits both syntactic and semantic information
                                to build a single and meaningful embedding space. Using a dependency
                                parser in combination with word embeddings, the model creates sequences
                                of inputs for a Recurrent Neural Network, which is then used for the
                                ranking purposes of the Task. The score obtained on the official test
                                data shows promising results.

                            <p>The aim of this project is to parallelize the Jacobi Iterative Method.
                                We have implemented three versions of the code using C++, a sequential one
                                and two parallel ones. The first parallel version has been implemented using
                                <a href="http://calvados.di.unipi.it/">FastFlow</a>, and the second one using C++11 pthread.
                                Each code version has been evaluated using different matrix sizes,
                                and measures (e.g., Completion Time, Scalability, Speed up, and Efficiency).
                                All the conducted experiments have been run using a Xeon Phi coprocessor,
                                which has 60 cores with 4 contexts each, clocked at 1GHz.

                                and we also included an L2 regularization term. The code has been realized using Python (2.7)

                      of the DOM element that has been changed since the previous rendering. Furthermore, we implemented a recursive descent parser that introduces the ability to express components in a style such as <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/jsx/#syntax">JSX</a>,
                      reading from an input stream. The programming language used in this project is JavaScript.

                                        <p>This work is a group project of the Pisa CoderDojo and a batch of computer science students. Here, we fork the Cpython repository, and we extend the grammar of the Python languange in order to use Italian key words as native constructor.
                                                Furthermore, to fully integrate the new keys, we modify the language interpreter is some parts, such as the EBNF grammar (i.e. adding new production), the AST (abstract syntax tree), and the built-in functions. In addition, we modify the standard IDLE to have an editor that highlight and hints the newly added words.
